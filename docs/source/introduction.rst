Introduction
====================

This repo was inspired by BlenderProc: https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc.git

The differences between this project and BlenderProc:

- Instead of writing config in BlenderProc, you can directly write python script to control the data generation process,
  which gives you more flexibility

- Simple but powerful functions, e.g., ``set_camera()``, ``set_projector()``, ``add_ply()``,
  ``physics_simulation()``, ``render_color()``
